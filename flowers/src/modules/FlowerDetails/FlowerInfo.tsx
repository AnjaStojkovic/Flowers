          Platycodon grandiflorus (from Ancient Greek πλατύς "wide" and κώδων
          "bell") is a species of herbaceous flowering perennial plant of the
          family Campanulaceae, and the only member of the genus Platycodon. It
          is native to East Asia (China, Korea, Japan, and the Russian Far
          East).[1] It is commonly known as balloon flower[2][3] (referring to
          the balloon-shaped flower buds), Chinese bellflower,[2] or
          platycodon.[2]

          Growing to 60 cm (24 in) tall by 30 cm (12 in) wide, it is an
          herbaceous perennial with dark green leaves and blue flowers in late
          summer. A notable feature of the plant is the flower bud which swells
          like a balloon before fully opening.[4] The five petals are fused
          together into a bell shape at the base, like its relatives, the
          campanulas. There are varieties with white, pink and purple blooms in
          cultivation. [5] In Korea, white flowers are more common. This
          plant[6] together with its cultivars 'Apoyama group'[7] and
          'Mariesii'[8] have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of
          Garden Merit.
